- My name is E0SelmY4V and I don't like speaking too much because of the Chinese common saying "言多必失" - It means "talks much, errs much".
- My English is poor and I’m a Chinese, so I speak Chinese commonly.
- The language I'm good at:
  - JavaScript
  - PHP
  - VBScript
  - batch
- The language I'm learning:
  - C / C++ / C#
  - Java
- The language that I don't like at all:
  - Python (We call it "屁眼通红（p y t hon）" in Chinese, which means "The particularly red ass")
