- My name is E0SelmY4V and I don't like speaking too much because of the Chinese common saying "言多必失" - It means "more words lead to more mistakes".
- My English is poor and I’m a Chinese, so I speak Chinese commonly.
- The language I'm good at:
  - JavaScript
  - PHP
  - VBScript
  - batch
  - Chinese
  - IE 6
- The language I'm learning:
  - C / C++ / C#
  - Java
  - math
  - English
  - Japanese
- The language that I don't like at all:
  - Python (We call it "屁眼通红（p y t hon）" in Chinese, which means "The particularly red ass")
  - 屁眼通红
  - Some language named from no-leg reptilian animal
